# Introduction to Cloud Services

Welcome to this gentle introduction course on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
In this course we will explore the fundamental concepts and key features of GCP, with a particular focus on the development and deployment of cloud applications.
This lesson is designed for people with little or no background on programming, eager to understand and use one of the cloud platforms in the sector.

## Google Cloud Platform: What is it
<!-- (20 Minuti) -->

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that run on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its consumer products like **Google Search**, **Gmail**, and **YouTube**. 
This means that the power and reliability that Google services rely on are now available for your projects.

GCP offers several **cloud computing service models** to meet various needs:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides basic computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, while leaving the user in control of the operating system and applications.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a complete environment for developing, running, and managing applications, without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure. **We will focus primarily on PaaS in this lab, with the introduction of a SaaS service later**. <!-- TODO: verifica -->
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Provides ready-to-use software applications, hosted and managed by the cloud provider.

<!-- TODO: arricchisci associando servizi di esempio di GCP al modello -->

GCP guarantees:

- **Scalability:** Applications can automatically scale based on demand.
- **Reliability:** Google's global infrastructure ensures high availability.
- **Flexibility:** Wide range of services for different needs.
